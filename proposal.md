<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size: 48px;"> Portfolio Website </h1>

## Author: Eli Lewis

 My plan is to create a portfolio website showcasing some of my skills to other developers and possible employers. I hope to include a page where I could write a blog and a landing page showcasing projects. Both of these I should be able to add or remove things from with relative ease.

## Features & Scope:
### The website will:
1. Be created using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, firestore, and be hosted on Github pages
2. Have a cool animated background
3. Be pretty
4. Be performant and usable on various device types (mobile, desktop)
5. Utilize a REST api
6. Utilize custom components
7. (Maybe) Be able to run things using webASM
