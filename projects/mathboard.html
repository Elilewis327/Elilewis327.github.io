                <h2> The Purpose </h2>
                I created Mathboard for my final Cs 108 project, as a way to help me do my math homework. 
                I wanted something that I could write equations out onto, and also have easy acess to a graphing calculator.
                <h2>Creating It </h2>
                We had been learning the python binding's for tkinter throughout that semester, so I used the tkinter canvas to create the whiteboard section. <br />
                I implemented:
                <ul>
                    <li>The whiteboard</li>
                    <li>Different drawing colors</li>
                    <li>A textbox</li>
                    <li>A bad graphing calculator</li>
                    <li>Some other simple features</li>
                </ul>
                Looking a year back on when I did it now, I would do a lot different today, such as 
                <ul>
                    <li>Organize the code more by seperating the state and the gui better</li>
                    <li>create a much better equation parser for the graphing calculator</li>
                    <li>not use python tkinter bindings (I think QT or GTK would be much nicer to use)</li>
                </ul>
                this is what the final ui looked like: <br />
                <img src="mathboard1.png" height="10%" width="10%" ></img> <br />
                and the graphing calculator: <br />
